A Brief Introduction
====================
Reverie Framework is an extremely versatile HTML5 WordPress framework based on ZURB's [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), a powerful tool for building prototypes on any kind of devices. Reverie follows [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) standard and is [hNews microformat](https://www.readability.com/publishers/guidelines) ready. It is optimized for Search Engine while at the same time improves readability.

It is extremely easy to create your blog, CMS, brochure and any other kind of sites with Reverie. You can see some [samples](http://foundation.zurb.com/prototyping.php) on ZURB and how they make these prototypes. Did I just mention Reverie works well with [bbPress 2.0](http://bbpress.org/) and [BuddyPress 1.5](http://buddypress.org/) even without styling?

What are the Features?
======================
Reverie Framework inherits all the cool features from Foundation, and packs with several other interesting features to optimize the experience for WordPress and HTML5. Including customized output for WordPress menus and caption. You can view the features list by scrolling down.

Reverie utilizes Foundation's grid to implement layouts. It is quite easy to start building your own layouts (like this page). You can read Foundation's [documentation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/grid.php) for how to implement these cool features.

###Basic Features###
* HTML5 Boilerplate standard and is hNews microformat ready.
* Optimized for SEO.

What about Mobile Devices?
==========================
Positive. With the power of Foundation, Reverie uses media query to adjust for all kinds of devices, including phones, tablets and computers. Reverie is also optimized for iPhone and iPad. Icons and loading images will be display when you save your website as a Home Screen app (example in the above image). Add this page to Home Screen on any iOS devices to see what I mean.

You can resize this page to see how Reverie responses according to different browser resolutions. Furthermore, to extend the flexibility of Reverie, I have a [forum](http://themefortress.com/discuss/forum/reverietheme/) specifically for users to contribute their own layouts and exchanges ideas.
